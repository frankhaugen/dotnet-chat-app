# dotnet-chat-app
A prototype for a chat application in .net Core 3 using a flat-file system

## Methodologies
This application uses Dependency Injection to manage dependencies. Sqlite is the database of choice for this, as it gives flat-file capabilities, but still allows the use of Linq2db which is an incredible tool

## How-to
Just play around with the code, but as it stands now, there's no possibility of changing the location of the DB file
